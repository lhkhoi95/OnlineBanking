## Installation Guide
### Softwares Requirements:

2) NodeJS
3) Python

### Python Virtual Environment Installation:
Open a new terminal and type the following commands:<br />
`cd server` <br />
`python -m venv venv` <br />
Windows OS:
`source venv/Scripts/activate`<br />

The (venv) indicates you have activated the virtual environment.

#### Back-end libraries installation:
`cd code` <br />
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br />

That should start the front-end server, and the landing page will be automatically opened by the default browser.
